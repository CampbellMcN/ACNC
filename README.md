# ACNC Visualisation project

This visualisation was created while experiementing with some data published by the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. 
The project was created as part of a job application

While preparing this job application, I created the chart above using 2019 Annual Information Statement Data from the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. 
The data is publicly available at data.gov.au

I created the chart using the R programming language. 

The chart maps the number of full-time equivalent staff working at a not-for-profit to the income that an organisation generates from its own operations 
(this excludes grants and government funding). Self-generated income is so important because it allows NFPs to pursue their mission on their own terms. 
This chart shows that staff at research based NFPs, those carrying out research in the public interest, are more productive in their generation of income than NFP 
staff in general. This goes against the usual narrative that research is utterly dependent on government grants and philanthropic funding. Perhaps there is something 
that we can learn from the strategies that research organisations are using to generate income.
